# FAQ - Frequently Asked Questions

## What is a Vault?

A vault is a will document that is created, stored, or managed in electronic form. The content is the same as a conventional will, which is a person's statement about the distribution of assets or special messages that take effect after they pass away.

> 📖 For complete information about services and what can be bequeathed, see [Vault Services](./service.md)

## How do I create a Vault?

1. Open the vault creation form
2. Fill in the will details (title, content)
3. Create 3-5 security questions with their answers
4. Set the opening time (trigger release)
5. Review the data you've entered
6. Make payment (Wander Wallet using AR token)
7. **Safely store the Vault ID and 5 fraction keys**
8. **Manually distribute fraction keys to trusted individuals**

> 📝 For a detailed form creation guide, see [Will Creation Guide](./steps.md)

## What is a Vault ID?

Vault ID is a unique identifier for each vault you create. Store your Vault ID safely as it's required to access the will in the future.

**Important**: Without the Vault ID, the will cannot be opened. Make sure you store the Vault ID in a safe place and inform trusted individuals.

## What are Fraction Keys?

Fraction Keys are encryption keys divided into multiple parts using Shamir Secret Sharing technique.

- Each will has 5 fraction keys
- **At least 3 of 5 fraction keys** are required to open the will vault
- Fraction keys must be distributed to trusted individuals
- This system ensures security and prevents unauthorized access

**Important**: Without at least 3 fraction keys, the vault cannot be opened. Make sure fraction keys are distributed to trusted individuals.

## How do I distribute Fraction Keys?

Fraction keys **must be given manually** by the will creator to trusted individuals.

**How to distribute**:
- After the will is created, you will see 5 fraction keys with copy buttons
- Distribute fraction keys through secure and trusted communication methods (encrypted email, secure messaging, or in person)
- Ensure at least 3 fraction keys are distributed to different trusted individuals
- Keep backup fraction keys in a safe place

> ⚠️ Fraction keys are not sent automatically. You are responsible for distributing them manually.

## How do I open/claim a will?

1. Use the inheritance claim form
2. Enter the **Vault ID**
3. Answer the **security questions** created when the will was made
4. Enter **at least 3 fraction keys**
5. The vault will open and you can view the will contents

> 📝 For a detailed claim guide, see [Vault Claim Guide](./claim-steps.md)

## Is will data secure?

Yes, will data is protected with **multi-layer encryption** including **Post-Quantum Cryptography (ML-KEM-768)** and **AES-256 encryption**, then stored permanently on the **blockchain storage**.

Multi-layer security:
- Post-Quantum encryption (ML-KEM-768) — protection against future quantum computer attacks
- AES-256 encryption for data (military-grade)
- Shamir Secret Sharing for keys (3-of-5 threshold)
- Permanent storage on blockchain storage
- Only with the correct combination of Vault ID, security questions, and fraction keys can the vault be opened

## What if I forget my Vault ID or Fraction Keys?

Unfortunately, **without the Vault ID and at least 3 fraction keys, the vault cannot be opened**. This system is designed for maximum security.

**Tips to avoid loss**:
- Store the Vault ID in multiple safe places (password manager, physical documents, encrypted cloud storage)
- Distribute fraction keys to at least 3 different trusted individuals
- Keep backup of important information in a safe place
- Consider informing trusted individuals about where this information is stored

## Can a will be changed after it's created?

It depends on the type of will chosen during creation:

- **One-time (Permanent)**: Permanent will, cannot be changed after creation
- **Editable**: Will can be changed using the will edit form

> 💡 Choose the type of will according to your needs. If you want flexibility, choose "Editable".

## How do I edit an existing will?

Only wills of type **Editable** can be changed:

1. Use the will edit form
2. Enter the **Vault ID**
3. Answer the **security questions**
4. Enter **at least 3 fraction keys**
5. Update the will contents as needed
6. **Make payment** (cost is the same as creating a new will)
7. Save changes

> ⚠️ Make sure your will is of "Editable" type before attempting to edit.
> 💰 **Important**: Each time you edit an editable will, there will be another fee similar to creating a new will, because the changed data needs to be re-stored on the blockchain storage.
> 📝 For a detailed edit guide, see [Vault Edit Guide](./edit-steps.md)

## What's the difference between One-time and Editable?

| Feature | One-time | Editable |
|---------|----------|----------|
| Can be changed | ❌ No | ✅ Yes |
| Security | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Very high | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ High |
| Suitable for | Final wills that are certain | Wills that may need updates |
| Edit cost | - | Fee applies (same as creating a new will) |

**Details**:
- **One-time**: After creation, the will cannot be changed at all. Suitable for wills that are final and certain.
- **Editable**: Will can be changed multiple times, but **each edit will incur a fee similar to creating a new will**. This fee is required because the changed data needs to be re-stored on the blockchain storage. Suitable if you want flexibility to update the will in the future.

## How much does it cost to create a Vault?

The cost of creating a will **varies depending on the blockchain storage price** at that time, because data is stored permanently on the blockchain storage.

**Factors affecting cost**:
- Will data size (content)
- Blockchain storage price per KB/MB at the time of creation
- Type of will (one-time or editable)

**Cost information**:
- Cost is calculated based on the size of data to be stored
- To find out the estimated cost, please check the blockchain storage cost calculator
- **Editing an editable will**: Each time you edit an editable will, there will be another fee similar to creating a new will, because the changed data needs to be re-stored on the blockchain storage
- Cost does not differ based on the payment method used

## What is Opening Time (Trigger Release)?

Opening time determines when the will can be opened by the heir. Currently 2 options are available:

1. **Anytime (Manual Release)**
   - Will can be opened anytime by the heir
   - No time restriction
   - Most flexible

2. **Specific Date**
   - Will opens automatically on the specified date
   - Choose a future date
   - Can use quick options (5/10/15/20 years) or custom date

## How do I distribute Fraction Keys?

After the will is successfully created, you will see **5 fraction keys** with a copy function for each key.

**Distribution method**:
- Copy each fraction key using the available copy button
- Distribute fraction keys to **at least 3 different** trusted individuals
- Make sure each person stores their fraction key safely
- **Don't give all 5 keys to one person** for maximum security

## What is an Blockchain Storage Transaction ID?

Blockchain Storage Transaction ID is the transaction identifier for data storage on the blockchain storage.

**Important information**:
- Transaction ID **does not need to be stored** by the user
- Used for internal system technical purposes
- **Not required** in the claim process by the heir
- Only Vault ID, security questions, and fraction keys are required to open the will

## What happens if payment fails?

If payment fails:
- The will has not been created and data has not been stored
- You can try again with the same or different payment method
- Make sure your balance is sufficient
- If the problem persists, contact support

## What if there's an error when creating a will?

If an error occurs:
- Before payment: You can go back to the previous step to fix it
- After payment: Contact support with the Vault ID (if already available)
- Make sure all data is correct in the review step before making payment
